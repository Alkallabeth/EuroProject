# EuroProject
### Basics
* Our AP European History board game project, due Wednesday May 24th
* The theme is the French Revolution (1789 - 1799)
***
### Coding Standards
* Code MUST BE READABLE, use lots of spaces, lines, and comments
* Commits must have detail of what was added/removed/modified
***
### How the game works
* An even number of players, divided into 2 teams: Girondins and Mountains/Jacobins, each player represents a historical figure (Robespierre, Olympe de Gouges, Georges Danton, etc.)
* During the first (liberal) phase, players will work together to advance through events (Tennis Court Oath, Storming of the Bastille, Women's March on Versailles, etc.)
* During the second (radical) phase, the 2 teams will work to defeat each other by competing to complete tasks/events
* Some blank spaces will be popularity +/- spaces, whichever person on the winning team that has the most popularity at the end wins
