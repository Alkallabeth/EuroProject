### How the game works
* An even number of players, divided into 2 teams: Girondins and Mountains/Jacobins, each player represents a historical figure (Robespierre, Olympe de Gouges, Georges Danton, etc.)
* During the first (liberal) phase, players will work together to advance through events (Tennis Court Oath, Storming of the Bastille, Women's March on Versailles, etc.)
* During the second (radical) phase, the 2 teams will work to defeat each other by competing to complete tasks/events
* Some blank spaces will be popularity +/- spaces, whichever person on the winning team that has the most popularity at the end wins
* Event spaces will be like STOP spaces in Life (player must stop)
* If a player fails an event space, they will lose popularity and/or move back spaces
* At the start of the radical phase, every player will get +5 popularity. If a player falls below a certain amount of popularity, they will be guillotined and be out of the game
